                <h3>What are Sunflower Seeds?</h3>
            
                <p>
                    Sunflower is the fourth most significant oilseed crop globally. It trails right after soybeans, rapeseed, and safflower as the most lucrative economic oilseed. When the sunflowers are dried, and the backs of the blooms turn brown, farmers harvest the seeds. As a result, sunflower seeds become plump and loose. It is time to collect them from the flower head easily.

                    Sunflower seeds are white and delicate, despite being enclosed in a black-and-white striped shell. You can consume the seeds raw, roasted, or add them into other dishes. They have a distinct nutty flavour and excellent nutritional content.
