                <h3>What is the Role of Vitamin B12?</h3>
            
                <p>
                    Vitamin B12 is an essential B vitamin. It is necessary to maintain the health of nerve tissue, brain function, and red blood cells. Vitamin B12 is also known as cobalamin. When this vitamin levels are too low, deficiency can occur. Additionally, vitamin B12 scarcity can result in permanent neurological problems.     
                    Vitamin B12, like the other B vitamins, is a water-soluble vitamin. It can dissolve in water and pass through the bloodstream. In this way, vitamin B12 reserves stay in the human body for four years. After that, the urine excretes any excess vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 is the most massive and physically complex of all the vitamins we consume. It can only be manufactured industrially by bacterial fermentation synthesis and exists naturally in animal products.
